A Web Based Random Number Generator For Prize Drawings that does not Duplicate

Many groups hold drawings for prizes at their meetings, and often multiple prizes are available.  This simple web page allows them to avoid the awkwardness of putting names in a hand and finding an uninvested party to pull a name from the hat.
The web page asks for a range of numbers, and then it will pick a number at random when requested.  Multiple numbers can be drawn and the same number will not be drawn twice.
